        Born a competitor, I strive to distinguish myself amidst the pack. I

        epic proportions for the local scene and beyond.

            <h4>League of Legends</h4>
            <p class="description">
              My conquest of the Rift began in Season 1. Starting as a Shaco
              1-Trick, I mained jungle for the first year of my competitive
              career. In Season 2, I transitioned to the Mid Lane, exclusively
              maining Ryze, LeBlanc, and Katarina. It wasn't until Season 3 that
              I found my true calling: Nidalee Mid. I quickly rose to
              Challenger Tier in Season 4, competing with the best players that
              North America could offer.

            <h4>Super Smash Bros. Melee</h4>
            <p class="description">
              Although Smash for the N64 was my first game in the series, Melee's
              fast paced, highly technical gameplay makes it a perfect match
              for a speed-seeking competitor like me. After playing the game for
              fun during much of my childhood, I discovered the professional scene
              when I accidentally turned on the EVO 2013 Twitch stream. Since then
              I decided to become a tournament host, launching VJA Smash. I also
              have attended many tournaments, including all three Smash n Splash
              events, while maining Captain Falcon and Falco.

            <h4>Warcraft</h4>
            <p class="description">
              My first online game was World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. It
              introduced me to an immersive virtual world with a vibrant community
              and immortal-seeming villains. Over a few years I leveled to 80 and
              defeated The Lich King with my guild, Horde to Death. In the
              meantime, I learned about the strategic roots of the game, namely
              Warcraft III. I still like to throw LAN parties once in a while to 
              play competitive and friendly matches with friends.

          <h3>VJA Smash Society</h3>
          <p>
            A high school club I founded  has become more than just a place
            to hang out after school. It has expanded across generations of
            students and alumni and into other cities, hosting tournaments
            multiple times a year and having yearly competitive seasons.
