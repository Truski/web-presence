            <h4>World of Warcraft</h4>
            <p class="description">
              My first online game was World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. It
              introduced me to an immersive virtual world with a vibrant community
              and immortal-seeming villains. Over a few years I leveled to 80, and
              then defeated The Lich King with my guild, Horde to Death. In the
              meantime, I learned about the strategic roots of the game, namely
              Warcraft III. I still like to throw LAN parties once in a while to
              play competitive and friendly matches with friends.

            <h4>League of Legends</h4>
            <p class="description">
              My conquest of the Rift began in Season 1. Starting as a Shaco
              1-Trick, I mained jungle for the first year of my competitive
              career. In Season 2, I transitioned to the Mid Lane, exclusively
              maining Ryze, LeBlanc, and Katarina. It wasn't until Season 3 that
              I found my true calling: Nidalee Mid. I quickly rose to
              Challenger Tier in Season 4, competing with the best players that
              North America could offer.

            <h4>Super Smash Bros. Melee</h4>
            <p class="description">
              Although Smash for the N64 was my first game in the series, Melee's
              fast paced, highly technical gameplay makes it a perfect match
              for a speed-seeking competitor like me. After playing the game for
              fun during much of my childhood, I discovered the professional scene
              when I accidentally turned on the EVO 2013 Twitch stream. Since then
              I decided to become a tournament host, launching VJA Smash. I also
              have attended many tournaments, including all three Smash n Splash
              events, while maining Captain Falcon and Falco.

              Every year, VJA Smash hosts a few major tournaments
              thematically related to the winter and/or summer seasons. The
              second iteration of the series, Inferno 2017, was the most hype
              VJA Smash event to date, featuring a large prize pool, a spectator
              arena, professional commentary, and TwitchMan, an app I wrote to
              bring the live stream to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              TwitchMan integrates with Challonge! as well as match statistics databases
              in order to streamline the live-streaming process. It combines a simple yet
              powerful user interface with automated matchup analysis and match reporting. Watch it
              in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTVZaUI8Bvs">
